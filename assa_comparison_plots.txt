Figure Legend:
--------------
Figure X. Annotated method comparison scatter plot of Ct values obtained from the Advanced Assay and the 
TaqMan Small RNA Assay (classic). Each point represents the Ct measurement for a given microRNA target 
(miR16, miR21, miR195, or miR425) in a specific sample. Points are color-coded by target, and the 
corresponding sample IDs are annotated next to each point. The dashed diagonal line represents the line of 
identity (y = x), indicating perfect agreement between the two assays. Points below the line indicate lower 
Ct values in the TaqMan assay, while points above the line indicate lower Ct values in the Advanced Assay.
